## :wave: Hello world :earth_africa:

I'm James C. Womack. As a [Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/), I develop robust software to solve research problems. My academic background is in computational chemistry with a focus on developing software and methods for simulating molecules and materials at the quantum level.

### :wrench: Currently working on
Developing code for accurate, efficient, and simple to set-up first-principles molecular dynamics simulations using [Entos Qcore](https://www.entos.ai/) (C++17, TBB parallelism)

### :gear: Projects I have contributed to

# :wave: Hello world :earth_africa:

I'm James C. Womack. As a research software and infrastructure engineer, I build and maintain robust software, platforms, and infrastructure to enable and accelerate research. My academic background is in computational chemistry, with a focus on software and methods for simulating molecules and materials at the quantum level.

## :wrench: Currently working on

I am currently working as an AI Supercomputing Infrastructure Engineer at the [Bristol Centre for Supercomputing (BriCS)](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/research/centres/bristol-supercomputing/) developing and operating infrastructure and scalable software platforms for BriCS's supercomputing facilities, including Isambard-AI and Isambard 3.

## :gear: Projects and services I have worked on

* Ask RSE, the [University of Bristol Research Software Engineering (RSE) team](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/research-software-engineering/)'s free-at-the-point-of-use research software consultancy service, supporting researchers to develop robust, high-quality research software
* [Entos Qcore](https://software.entos.ai/qcore), a modern quantum chemistry package written in C++17 with TBB parallelism
* [ONETEP](https://onetep.org/), a package for performing large-scale quantum chemistry calculations with linear-scaling computational cost (Fortran 2003, MPI+OpenMP)
* [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org/), a widely-used quantum chemistry and materials modelling package (Fortran 95, MPI)
* [DL_MG](http://dlmg.org), an open-source multigrid Poisson solver library used in ONETEP and CASTEP (Fortran, MPI+OpenMP)
* [Intception](https://intception-code-generator.github.io/), an open-source package that generates code for evaluating common integrals in quantum chemistry from an abstract mathematical specification (Python, generates C)

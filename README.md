## :wave: Hello world :earth_africa:

I'm James C. Womack. As a [Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/), I develop robust software to solve research problems. My academic background is in computational chemistry, developing software and methods for simulating molecules and materials at the quantum level.

### :wrench: Currently working on
My current role is as RSE support specialist at the [University of Bristol Advanced Computing Research Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/). I work with researchers in a variety of disciplines to develop and maintain high-quality software to solve research problems. I provide general RSE support to researchers via consultation, training, and collaboration.

### :gear: Projects I have worked on
* [Entos Qcore](https://www.entos.ai/), a modern quantum chemistry package written in C++17 with TBB parallelism
* [ONETEP](https://onetep.org/), a package for performing large-scale quantum chemistry calculations with linear-scaling computational cost (Fortran 2003, MPI+OpenMP)
* [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org/), a widely-used quantum chemistry and materials modelling package (Fortran 95, MPI)
* [DL_MG](http://dlmg.org), an open-source multigrid Poisson solver library used in ONETEP and CASTEP (Fortran, MPI+OpenMP)
* [Intception](https://intception-code-generator.github.io/), an open-source package that generates code for evaluating common integrals in quantum chemistry from an abstract mathematical specification (Python, generates C)

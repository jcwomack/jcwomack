## :wave: Hello world :earth_africa:

I'm James C. Womack. As a [Research Software Engineer (RSE)](https://society-rse.org/), I develop robust software to solve research problems. My academic background is in computational chemistry and my current focus is developing software and methods for simulating molecules and materials at the quantum level.

### :wrench: Currently working on
Developing code for accurate, efficient, and simple to set-up first-principles molecular dynamics simulations using [Entos Qcore](https://www.entos.ai/), a modern quantum chemistry package written in C++17 with TBB parallelism

### :gear: Projects I have worked on
* [ONETEP](https://onetep.org/), a package for performing large-scale quantum chemistry calculations with linear-scaling computational cost (Fortran 2003, MPI+OpenMP)
* [CASTEP](http://www.castep.org/), a widely-used quantum chemistry and materials modelling package (Fortran 95, MPI)
* [DL_MG](http://dlmg.org), an open-source multigrid Poisson solver library used in ONETEP and CASTEP (Fortran, MPI+OpenMP)
* [Intception](http://intception.net), an open-source package that generates code for evaluating common integrals in quantum chemistry from an abstract mathematical specification (Python, generates C)
